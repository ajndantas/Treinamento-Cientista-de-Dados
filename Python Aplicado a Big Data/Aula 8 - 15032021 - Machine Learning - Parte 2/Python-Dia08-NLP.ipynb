      "He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment , speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \" at a proper level .\" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time . \n",
      "South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won . \n",

      "4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4 . \n",
      "3 billion dlrs in 1985 . \n",
      "Kim , who is also economic planning minister , said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy , but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years . \n",
      "\" Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth , five billion dlrs of ( current account ) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year . \n",
      "But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected ,\" he said . \n",
      "Trade ministry officials said South Korea ' s exports rose 35 pct to 9 . \n",
      "34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year , while imports rose only 8 . \n",
      "5 pct to 8 . \n",
      "2 billion dlrs . \n",
      "Kim said the swing of South Korea ' s current account to a surplus of 4 . \n",
      "65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant . \n",
      "The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time . \n",
      "South Korea ' s foreign debt , which fell to 44 . \n",
      "5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46 . \n",
      "8 billion in 1985 , is still among the largest in Asia . \n",
      "\" This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development ... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country ' s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991 , from about 50 pct in 1986 . \n",
      "\" The government , however , does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus ,\" he said . \n",
      "Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul ' s major trading partners , particularly the United States . \n",
      "\" We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt , but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices , sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance ( CPA ) said . \n",
      "The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11 - member CPA which began on Monday . \n",
      "They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices . \n",
      "Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon . \n",
      "Prices , under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses , recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules . \n",
      "The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre - set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise . \n",
      "\" The world ' s cocoa price at present is just not interesting ,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer . \n",
      "Another source said that with much of the 1986 / 87 ( October - September ) world cocoa crop sold , limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year ' s harvest . \n",
      "The sources noted , however , that the cocoa industry in Brazil , the world ' s number two producer , is in private hands . \n",
      "This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers , where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards . \n",
      "The CPA includes the world ' s top three producers , Ivory Coast , Brazil and Ghana , and accounts for 80 pct of all output . \n",
      "The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening . \n",
      "COCOA TERMINAL DEPOSITS TO BE CUT 25 PCT - ICCH The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday , April 10 , taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously , a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House ( ICCH ) said . \n",
      "The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut , to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously , he said . \n",
      "The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks , he said , adding the market ' s basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates . \n",
      "The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market , the spokesman said . \n",
      "The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market , he said . \n",
      "WORLD BANK TO SUPPORT SRI LANKA IF DEFICITS CUT The World Bank will support Sri Lanka ' s development program provided the country reduces its budget and current account deficits , the Ministry of Finance said . \n",
      "It said Bank President Barber Conable at a meeting with Sri Lanka ' s Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel in Washington also emphasised the need for structural adjustment and reform to the economy , battered by five years of separatist disturbances . \n",
      "Officials said Sri Lanka ' s budget deficit this year is expected to surpass the projected 28 . \n",
      "7 billion rupees while defence spending , already up by two billion rupees from a targetted 10 billion , is also likely grow . \n",

      "Spain ' s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non - oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986 . \n",

      "COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks , cocoa traders said . \n",
      "Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly , given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market . \n",

      "03 Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) per tonne , below the 1 , 600 \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council . \n",

      "Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end - April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 , 600 SDR \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second , third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets . \n",
      "The daily price was 1 , 577 . \n",

      "The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market . \n",
      "But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 - day average , the indicator which governs his activities , traders said . \n",
      "\" The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa ,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . \n",
      "Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts . \n",
      "If purchases reach this level within six months , buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges . \n",

      "In these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 tonnes to lift prices above the \" must buy \" level . \n",
      "But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . \n",
      "The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non - members could limit the buffer stock ' s scope for action , dealers said . \n",
      "Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . \n",
      "But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . \n",
      "Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . \n",
      "Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . \n",
      "Ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . \n",
      "\" The buffer stock may not help the terminal market , but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas ,\" one trader said . \n",
      "Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \" all prognostication \" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be . \n",
      "Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 , 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . \n",

      "\" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,\" Roldan said . \n",
      "The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . \n",
      "But he added : \" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels .\" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . \n",
      "Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . \n",
      "\" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,\" one senior coffee dealer said . \n",
      "The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . \n",
      "At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . \n",
      "Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . \n",
      "\" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,\" he said . \n",
      "New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . \n",
      "29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . \n",
      "68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . \n",
      "President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . \n",
      "Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . \n",
      "\" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,\" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . \n",
      "Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . \n",
      "\" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,\" he said . \n",
      "The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . \n",
      "\" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . \n",

      "He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . \n",
      "Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . \n",
      "\" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,\" Eshleman said . \n",
      "But he added it will be a while before U . \n",
      "S . \n",
      "exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . \n",
      "Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . \n",
      "He said the debt situation was a major consideration . \n",
      "\" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,\" he added . \n",
      "Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . \n",
      "On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . \n",
      "Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . \n",
      "The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . \n",
      "Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . \n",
      "\" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,\" one analyst said . \n",

      "AUSTRALIAN CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SEEN NARROWING Australia ' s current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs , from the unrevised January level of 1 . \n",
      "29 billion , market economists polled by Reuters said . \n",
      "Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow . \n",
      "The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January , after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs . \n",
      "As an example they quoted wheat export volume , which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January . \n",
      "A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit , the economists said . \n",
      "Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments , they said . \n",

      "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said . \n",
      "Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated . \n",
      "This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work . \n",
      "The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations . \n",
      "The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade . \n",
      "A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend . \n",
      "Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought . \n",
      "One consumer country delegate said this would \" distort , not support \" the market . \n",
      "Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder . \n",
      "On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows . \n",
      "The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices . \n",
      "The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \" must buy \" level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock . \n",
      "Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given . \n",
      "The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets . \n",
      "A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement . \n",
      "Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade . \n",
      "It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes . \n",
      "The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa . \n",
      "Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday . \n",
      "Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia . \n",
      "Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas . \n",
      "The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market . \n",
      "Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa . \n",
      "Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand , forcing all prices lower . \n",
      "The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers . \n",
      "EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations . \n",
      "The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there . \n",
      "One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \" meant to support the market where trade buying is not .\" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers . \n",
      "Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \" posted price \" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers . \n",
      "In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers . \n",
      "COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules , delegates said . \n",
      "While consumers do not yet have a common position , an observer said after a consumer meeting , \" They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive .\" European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect , delegates said . \n",
      "At the January meeting , France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate , delegates said . \n",
      "That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules . \n",
      "The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month ' s meeting . \n",
      "The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues , delegates said . \n",
      "The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non - member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa , delegates said . \n",
      "A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non - member cocoa question . \n",
      "A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning , then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting , followed by a consumer meeting . \n",
      "Producers , who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non - member cocoa being accepted , reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon . \n",
      "\" We are waiting to see what consumers say ,\" a producer delegate said . \n",
      "\" We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate .\" The ICCO comprises 33 member countries . \n",

      "Standard and Poor ' s said it had downgraded the Kingdom of Denmark ' s long - term external debt to AA from AA - Plus , following the country ' s loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983 . \n",
      "\" This change is regrettable but there is no reason to dramatise . \n",
      "This is a change of nuance . \n",
      "Standard and Poor ' s defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top AAA rating ,\" Simonsen said in a statement . \n",
      "\" The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing capability is unlikely to be very great . \n",
      "But if , against expectation , we fail to reduce permanently the external account deficit ... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and capability ,\" he added . \n",
      "\" Standard & amp ; Poor ' s has noted that in 1986 there was a series of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and encourage saving . \n",
      "Tax reforms have also gone into effect . \n",
      "\" If and when it becomes necessary , the government will be ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives as it has in the past ,\" Simonsen said . \n",
      "Standard and Poor ' s said weaker international competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external debt . \n",
      "The external current account deficit rose to a record preliminary 34 . \n",

      "ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW The International Cocoa Organization , ICCO , council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow , delegates said . \n",
      "ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a \" pre - compromise \" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday , they said . \n",
      "While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented , both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement , they said . \n",
      "\" I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day , but some time later in the session ,\" a consumer delegate said . \n",

      "Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non - member cocoa also , and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin . \n",

    "#### Lemmatização na linguística, é o processo de agrupar as diferentes formas flexionadas de uma palavra para que possam ser analisadas como um único item.\n",
    "#### Na linguística computacional, a Lemmatização é o processo algorítmico de determinação do lema para uma determinada palavra. \n",
    "#### Uma vez que o processo pode envolver tarefas complexas, como entender o contexto e determinar a parte da fala de uma palavra em uma frase \n",
    "#### (requerendo, por exemplo, conhecimento da gramática de uma linguagem), pode ser uma tarefa difícil implementar um lematizador para uma nova língua.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Em muitas línguas, as palavras aparecem em várias formas inflexíveis. \n",
    "#### Por exemplo, em inglês, o verbo 'to walk' pode aparecer como 'walk', 'walk', 'walkks', 'walking'. \n",
    "#### A forma base, 'walk', que se poderia procurar em um dicionário, é chamado de lema para a palavra. \n",
    "#### A combinação da forma base com a parte da fala geralmente é chamada de lexema da palavra.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Lemmatização está intimamente relacionada com o Stemming. \n",
    "#### A diferença é que um stemmer opera em uma única palavra sem conhecimento do contexto e, portanto, não pode discriminar entre palavras \n",
    "#### que têm diferentes significados, dependendo da parte da fala. No entanto, os stemmers são geralmente mais fáceis de implementar e executar mais \n",
    "#### rapidamente, e a precisão reduzida pode não ser importante para algumas aplicações.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stemming e Lemmatization são operações parecidas. A principal diferença entre eles é que o Stemmning pode gerar palavras geralmente inexistentes, \n",
    "#### enquanto as lemas são palavras reais.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assim, sua root stem pode não ser algo que você pode procurar em um dicionário, mas você pode procurar um lema. \n",
    "#### Algumas vezes você terminará com uma palavra muito semelhante, mas as vezes, você terminará com uma palavra completamente diferente. Vamos ver alguns exemplos."
